/*In this question, you have to output the "moving average" of a
sequence of non-negative numbers. The moving average is the sequence
of averages of the last 2 entries. For the first number, no average
is output.

For example, if the sequence of numbers is

a1, a2, a3, a4, a5

then the 2-moving average is

(a1+a2)/2, (a2+a3)/2, (a3+a4)/2, (a4+a5)/2 


Input
-----

The input is a sequence of non-negative floating point numbers,
terminated by a -1. The -1 is not part of the sequence. There will be
at least 3 numbers in the sequence.

Output
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to output the moving average of the sequence. The output
should be printed correct to one digit after the decimal. 

Sample Input 1
-------------------------------------
1 2 3 -1

Sample Output 1
-------------------------
 1.5 2.5*/
